This is the final submission for the final project in COGS 108 - Data Science in Practice. Contained are the final project notebook which contains all of the relevant code as well as a final presentation video. Also the supplmentary notebook has also been included, but it really only contains information that didn't lead to any meaningful statistics, but we as a group still wanted to document the work we had done throughout the entire lifespan of the project.
